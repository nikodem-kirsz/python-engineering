State Pattern:
Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

Composite Pattern:
Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Chain of Responsibility Pattern:
Passes a request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process it or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

Template Method Pattern:
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the base class but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

Visitor Pattern:
Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
